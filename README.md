The project uses the JC3248W535EN-Touch-LCD display board with a 480×320-pixel resolution.
It provides two game modes: local two-player mode and player-versus-AI mode.
The AI offers three difficulty levels ranging from easy to hard. You can further enhance or extend these levels to increase the challenge, using specialized algorithms for game-logic processing.
The code is a demo version—functional, but it requires additional testing to finalize and validate all gameplay rules.
